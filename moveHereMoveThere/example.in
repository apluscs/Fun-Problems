Please enter the following in 0-based format. Please enter any coordinates as 'x y' and any vectors as 'x-component y-component'. 
The top-left corner is (0,0), and the bottom-right corner is (N-1, M-1). Up is a negative y-direction. Down is a positive y-direction. 
Left is a negative x-direction. Right is a positive x-direction. 
The template goes as follows:

**Make sure there is no white space above the first two numbers**
#rows #columns
x-target-location y-target-location
x-source-location y-source-location
#commands-in-source-cell
each command: 
	x-direction y-direction
#set-blocks
each set block: 
	x-position y-position
	#commands-in-block
	each command: 
		x-direction y-direction
#moveable-blocks:
each moveable block:
	#commands-in-block
	each command: 
		x-direction y-direction
